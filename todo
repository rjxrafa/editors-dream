Considerations:

Binary Trees
    - which container to use for line numbers in binary tree nodes
    Needed functions
    - insertion
    - deletion
    - searching element
    - tree traversal (level order traversal)
    - find max/min/any
    Auxiliary functions
    - tree height
    - finding least common ancestor for nodes
    - AVL balance
    - replace function calls (set) with their constituents for opimization?
    - finish extractor for bst
Heap
