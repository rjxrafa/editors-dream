Considerations:

Binary Trees
    Needed functions
    - tree traversal (level order traversal)
    - find max/min/any
    Auxiliary functions
    - finding least common ancestor for nodes
    - AVL balance
    - replace function calls (set) with their constituents for opimization?
    - finish extractor for bst
    - move semantics for templated data in node
Heap
    - input validation when file not found
